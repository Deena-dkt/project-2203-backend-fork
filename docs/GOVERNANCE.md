# Repository Governance Rules

## File Creation Rules
- The repository has a hard limit of 25 files.
- No new files may be added unless explicitly approved.
- Existing files must be extended or consolidated instead.

## Documentation Rules
- Financial rules must live ONLY in `FINANCIAL_RULES.md`.
- No duplicate rule definitions across files.
- Documentation sprawl is considered technical debt.

## Copilot / AI Rules
- AI tools must not create new files by default.
- AI tools must prefer modifying existing files.
- If a new file seems necessary, AI must stop and explain why.
